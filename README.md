# Periodic_table
Relational Database Practice

This is the part of the freecodecamp Relational Database course project assignments. 
The idea of the project is to practice some git commands and writing a code one bash
which can query information from already given database. The periodic_table database
has been already given. The database contained two tables elements which has
atomic_number, symbol, and name columns, and properties which contains the information
about each element. The third table named types were added as part of the project.
There two files included here. The periodic_table.sql is the dump of the database
and element.txt contains the script. 

P.S. Thank you for the freecodecamp for providing oportunity to learn and study something new for free.
